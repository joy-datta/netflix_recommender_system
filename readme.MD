# Netflix Recommender System
Used [Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) from Kaggle. I used a simple technique (cosine similarity) to perform pairwise similarity checking and based on the resulting score the system recommends the possible contents that an user might like.
